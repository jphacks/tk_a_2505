your first mission is to generate prompt that generates "Badge" image based on the conditions that I provide. image file itself should be the badge itself, without any background(so that I could provide this badge itself to user). inside the badge, use the region or any related symbols instead of using the natural language inside the image. provide the enough information of this region in the prompt. this badge is either Pokemon-badge style or at least cartoon-like style. This badge **should** be collectable badge that makes user excited and motivated to collect more badges.

Example

Pokemon-style collectible badge, a detailed illustration of an iconic Tokyo Dome structure rendered in a simplified, sleek, and slightly stylized manner, integrated smoothly within a circular or shield-like badge shape. The badge itself has a shiny, metallic finish with a subtle golden or silver outline. Inside, incorporate subtle visual motifs representing Kōrakuen's amusement park rides (like a Ferris wheel outline or roller coaster track) and the serene, traditional elements of Kōrakuen Garden (like a stylized traditional Japanese bridge or a ginkgo leaf pattern). The overall color palette should be vibrant and inviting, utilizing a mix of modern urban blues/greys for the Dome and contrasting traditional greens/reds/golds for the garden elements, all with high contrast and clean lines. The design should feel premium, desirable, and visually exciting, encouraging collection. The background of the badge itself is fully transparent, showcasing only the badge. Dynamic lighting to emphasize the collectible nature, cartoon-like, high detail, smooth rendering.
